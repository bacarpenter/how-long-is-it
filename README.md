# how-long-is-it

## A web app meant to help people visualize conversions between units

If you were raised on imperial units like me, you could probably tell me, roughly, how long of a 60-mile drive is. You have an idea in your head about how heavy 5 pounds is because you interact with these measurements on a daily basis. For many, this breaks down when you think about metric units! How long is a 4 km walk? Short? Supper long? My guess is that you don't know.

My app fixes this! On the site, you can see metric units equated to everyday things you would encounter!

In making this, I encountered a few problems. I decided for the first time to experiment with a CSS framework, Bootstrap to be specific! While it simplified a number of things and produced a nicer looking product than I would have made without it, I lacked the familiarity I needed to be able to customize. With more time, I think I could produce a much nicer looking product, however, I am happy with the simple, but fun functionality of my site. In the end, I am super proud that I was able to go from an idea to a site, too many times I've found myself starting things, but not seeing them through. This feels way better! üòÅüê¢
